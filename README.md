####  Overview
cURL is an open source command line tool and library written in C with more than 5 billion installations worldwide. cURL is used in command lines or scripts to transfer data. It is also used in cars, television sets, routers, printers, audio equipment, mobile phones, tablets, set-top boxes, as well as media players, and is the internet transfer backbone for thousands of software applications affecting billions of humans daily. The cURL software project provides a library for transferring data using various protocols. These protocols include (but are not limited to) FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS and more.

#### Usage
cURL can be used in multiple different ways depending on the desired end result. If the user wants to have a task that repetitively checks the status of a server’s HTTP/SSH processes, it can be used to securely download .zip files through a proxy, it has the abilty to do this as well.
