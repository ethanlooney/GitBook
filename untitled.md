# cURL

#### Usage
cURL can be used in multiple different ways depending on the desired end result. If the user wants to have a task that repetitively checks the status of a server’s HTTP/SSH processes, it can be used to securely download .zip files through a proxy, it has the abilty to do this as well.

#### tinycurl
In addition to the curl library being licensed and having
support provided by wolfSSL, there is also a new library in
its beta stage that is also licensed and supported by wolfSSL 
&ndash; the tinycurl library! 
tinycurl is a version of curl that is capable of performing HTTPS and fits within 100K (including the wolfSSL library) on a typical 32 bit architecture. It is approximately one-quarter of the size of the typical cURL build on Debian-based Linux with an x86-64 architecture.

The latest version of tinycurl can be found on the wolfSSL [downloads](wolfssl.com/downloads) page.
